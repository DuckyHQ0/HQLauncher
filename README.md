## About

HQLauncher is a Minecraft launcher that aims to include many useful features such as:
- Instance managment
- Creation of vanilla, and modded instances
- Download modpacks straight from the launcher
- Easy to use and secure account manager, with skins
- Mod, shaderpack and resourcepack managment in instances
- Mod downloading staight from the launcher in instances
- Automatic updating for the launcher, modpacks, and mods
- And more!

Right now, none of the features work. I am currently building the frontend. If any of you would like to help with the backend, feel free to reach out to dukkcc on most platforms.
